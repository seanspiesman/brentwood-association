        Brentwood is a neighborhood in central Austin, Texas. The area is
        bordered by Burnet Road on the west, Lamar Blvd on the east, 45th Street
        on the south and Justin Lane on the north. The City of Austin annexed
        most of the neighborhood in 1946 and purchased the land next to
        Brentwood Elementary to establish the neighborhood's Brentwood Park in
        1951. Running through the middle of the area is a tree-lined street
        named Arroyo Seco which follows a creek of the same name. Our annual
        holiday luminaria display is just one of our many beloved traditions.

        Brentwood is now a trendy and popular area that is home to gorgeous
        tree-lined streets and established homes. Many of the homes are bungalow
        style homes, normally one story, and have a low to medium pitched roof
        and simple, rectangular shapes. Many were originally two bedrooms and
        were purchased by GIs who wanted to start families following WWII. The
        combination of original residents who never left the 'hood and a growing
        number of newcomers have built a strong community which fits perfectly
        with the style of Austin.
