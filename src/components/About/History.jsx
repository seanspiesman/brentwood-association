        Brentwood (and Crestview to the north) began to be developed in earnest
        in the late 1940s, after the end of World War II. Many original
        residents were veterans. Some had grown up on farms outside Austin and
        were of Swedish and German descent. The G. I. Bill, a Federal law passed
        in 1944, helped veterans purchase the relatively affordable homes for
        their young, growing families.

        Much of the land in this area had once been owned by John Hancock
        (1821-1893), a prominent Austin lawyer, district judge, and Texas
        legislator. Hancock Creek (also known as Hancock Branch) passes through
        Crestview and Brentwood along the divided street named Arroyo Seco and
        eventually flows into Shoal Creek. In the early 1950s, unpaved streets
        and swampy areas near the creek were challenging for builders and early
        residents, so the C. H. Lester Construction Company dug a deeper channel
        for the creek.

        <br />
        The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI), along the
        southern edge of Brentwood, moved to West 45th Street in 1917. A few
        years earlier, one observer described the area beyond 45th, then outside
        the Austin city limits: “On the north . . . stretch rich farming lands
        that were once illimitable prairies. Westward . . . is a chain of hills
        which make a purplish background for the intervening fields in various
        shades of green and gold.”
        <br />
        <br /> TSBVI once had a working farm north of the school up to North
        Loop. Sunshine Community Gardens was established on three acres of the
        original farm in 1983. The remainder of the property north of West 49th
        is home to the Texas Department of State Health Services.
        <br />
        <br /> Along the north side of West 49th between Woodrow and Grover are
        a row of homes and businesses with similar limestone facades. The
        stonework likely was done by Frank B. Wright (Benjamin Franklin Wright),
        a skilled stonemason and builder and World War II veteran. He created
        other homes and businesses, many with similar stone facades, in the area
        during the 1940s and 1950s.

        In 1947, when Charles McCullough, Dr. Joseph S. Koenig, and A. G. Adams
        Jr. began developing Violet Crown Heights between Payne and Ruth streets
        in Brentwood, they advertised the lots as having a “beautiful view of
        the Violet Crown Hills.” With so few trees on the land, early neighbors
        could easily see the hills to the west and the violet glow that
        sometimes appeared over them at sunset. Austin was first described as
        the “City of the Violet Crown” in the early 1890s. Centuries earlier,
        the phrase was used to describe Athens, Greece. The Violet Crown
        Shopping Center was built on the northwest corner of Brentwood and North
        Lamar. By 1953, the center had four businesses with “Violet Crown” in
        their names, including a beauty salon, grocery, pharmacy, and a barber
        shop. Later called Cockrell Barber Shop, it closed in 2016 when Tom
        Cockrell, a barber for 60 years, retired. Since 2003, Brentwood and
        Crestview have become the home of the Violet Crown Festival, Violet
        Crown Community Works, Violet Crown Community Theater, and Voices of the
        Violet Crown community/history project. Daniel Gay built the Capitol
        Roll Arena in 1954 at 821 Brentwood St., across from the Violet Crown
        Shopping Center. The only known roller skating rink in North Austin at
        the time, it was popular with children and adults for several decades.
        (It may have been constructed by Frank B. Wright, based on information
        from his family matching the structure’s description, location, and year
        it was built.) Today, the building houses a body shop.

        <b>SCHOOLS</b>
        <br /> Before Brentwood and Crestview were annexed by the city,
        Esperanza School, once on the northeast corner of today’s Romeria and
        Burnet Road, served local students who lived on farms outside the Austin
        city limits between 1893 and 1941. According to a 1936 history of the
        Travis County rural schools, although the school’s name was Spanish,
        there were no records of any Hispanic students and no Hispanic or
        African-American schools in the district. The first Esperanza School was
        built in 1866 near today’s Spicewood Springs Rd. and Mopac. Today, that
        original log structure is at Zilker Botanical Garden in Austin. It
        received a Texas Historical Marker in 1974. In 1936, Franklin Edmond
        (Frank) Pease, distant cousin of Texas politician Elisha M. Pease, moved
        with his large family to a 14-acre farm facing today’s Burnet Lane in
        Brentwood. In the 1940s Frank Pease sold some of his property for homes
        and for Brentwood Elementary School, which opened in 1951. During the
        Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, a bomb shelter was built under the
        concrete outdoor stage on the north side of the school, according to
        several longtime neighbors. McCallum High School, also in Brentwood, was
        built in 1953.

        <b>CHURCHES</b>
        <br /> Brentwood and Crestview have more than a dozen churches that
        continue to thrive and have active education and community outreach
        programs. Some of the churches were built along Woodrow Ave., nicknamed
        “Church Row” by longtime neighbors, and most have mosaics on the Wall of
        Welcome. Among the oldest churches in Brentwood are: Faith Lutheran
        Church (1950), First Cumberland Presbyterian Church (since 1956 at the
        Brentwood location) shown on the right, First Unitarian Universalist
        Church (1951), Koenig Lane Christian Church (since 1955 at the Brentwood
        location), and Northwest Baptist Church (1952).

        <b>GREENSPACES</b>
        <br /> In 1951, the City of Austin acquired a former cornfield north of
        Brentwood Elementary for Brentwood Park, the greenspace for Brentwood
        and Crestview. Early neighbors formed the Brentwood Recreation Club and
        coordinated with the city to develop and maintain the park, which had
        few trees. In 1952, the group held a festival to raise funds for
        playground equipment. In 1953, members helped build the stage on the
        north side of Brentwood Elementary. For several years, the group held
        annual tree and shrub plantings at the park and school.

        <br />
        <br />
        Individual neighbors also helped care for the park over the years. Since
        2009, the Friends of Brentwood Park, including Crestview and Brentwood
        neighbors, have helped maintain and develop it as a community resource
        through workdays, including the 2010 planting of 115 trees, and
        fundraising for park enhancements. Projects completed by the group since
        2012 include a park pavilion, walking trail, benches, stainless steel
        drinking fountain, and backstop fencing. Along once-bare Arroyo Seco,
        Brentwood neighbors began coordinating tree plantings in 1992, and
        neighbors in Crestview have continued the plantings north of Justin
        Lane. Trees also have been planted along Burnet Road and North Lamar and
        near McCallum High School. Each year since 1994, neighbors have
        coordinated the holiday tradition of luminarias all along Arroyo Seco.

        <b>FILM/TV LOCATIONS</b>
        <br /> Sites in Brentwood continue to be popular for period films and
        television shows. Richard Linklater filmed Dazed and Confused (1993) at
        the Violet Crown Shopping Center and the body shop that once housed the
        Capitol Roll Arena in Brentwood, as well as Top Notch in Crestview. A
        pink home in Brentwood was used in early scenes of Linklater’s film
        Boyhood (2014).
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>LONGTIME RESTAURANTS</b>
        <br /> In 1933, Threadgill’s “gas station and beer joint” opened outside
        the Austin city limits on the Dallas Highway (today’s North Lamar in
        Brentwood). Until 1974, owner Kenneth Threadgill performed at the club
        and encouraged other musicians, including Janis Joplin, who sang there
        in the 1960s. Purchased in 1981 by Eddie Wilson, owner of the Armadillo
        World Headquarters, Threadgill’s continues as a restaurant, bar, and
        music venue, filled with memorabilia from the original Threadgill’s and
        other Austin landmarks. Kenneth Threadgill was inducted into the Austin
        Music Memorial in 2010. In 1953, Harry Akins opened the Frisco Shop at
        5819 Burnet Road in Brentwood. It moved to its current location at 6501
        Burnet Road in 2008. It is the last of Akins’ four Night Hawk
        restaurants; the first one opened in Austin in 1932. Decades before
        “equal opportunity,” Akins hired and promoted African Americans and
        women. In the early 1960s, he also was the first white restaurateur in
        Austin to serve African Americans.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>LOCAL DRIVE-INS</b> <br /> In 1940, Eddie Joseph’s Drive-in opened,
        the first of four outdoor movie theatres in the area. It was outside the
        city limits then, at today’s 6812 North Lamar in Brentwood (site of
        Walgreen’s). At first, there was only one large speaker for the sound,
        which disturbed the peace at Frank Richcreek’s once-quiet farm just to
        the north. At times, Richcreek let local teenagers watch the show from
        the top of his large dairy barn. Nearby neighbors remember sitting in
        their yards to see a movie. When the wind was just right they could hear
        it, too. Eventually each car had its own speaker. In 1947, Eddie
        Joseph’s became the North Austin Drive-in, and the Chief, which was
        larger and had more amenities, opened a mile south on the southeast
        corner of Koenig and North Lamar. Other nearby drive-ins were the Burnet
        (1952-1970s, today’s Burnet Road Self-Storage) and Longhorn (1954-late
        1960s, Anderson Lane near 183). The North Austin closed in 1960; the
        Chief closed in 1973.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>NEWER HISTORY</b> <br /> In 2003, Brentwood and Crestview volunteers
        created the Violet Crown Festival and the nonprofit Violet Crown
        Community Works to help raise funds for the mosaic Wall of Welcome. The
        festival is now an annual tradition, and the nonprofit continues to
        support neighborhood enhancement projects. The Wall of Welcome, created
        and installed by Brentwood artist Jean Graham with the help of hundreds
        of neighbors of all ages, was completed and dedicated in 2008. Gracing a
        long brick wall along Woodrow Avenue, it colorfully depicts neighborhood
        history through images and words. Another collaborative mosaic project
        spearheaded by Jean Graham was completed in 2004 on the west side of
        Brentwood Elementary.

        Domino was a young spotted pig that escaped into the neighborhood from
        the petting zoo at the first Violet Crown Festival in 2003 and became a
        neighbor’s pet for a time. Today, he is a local legend. He is remembered
        in a mosaic on the north end of the Wall of Welcome; as the 10-foot-long
        pig puppet featured at First Night Austin, the Violet Crown Festival,
        and other events; and in the local film “First Night W/Domino &
        Friends.”
