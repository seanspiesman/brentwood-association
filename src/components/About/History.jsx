      <h4> Brentwood Beginnings</h4>
      <p>
        Brentwood (and Crestview to the north) began to be developed in earnest
        in the late 1940s, after the end of World War II. Many original
        residents were veterans. Some had grown up on farms outside Austin and
        were of Swedish and German descent. The G. I. Bill, a Federal law passed
        in 1944, helped veterans purchase the relatively affordable homes for
        their young, growing families.

        Much of the land in this area had once been owned by John Hancock
        (1821-1893), a prominent Austin lawyer, district judge, and Texas
        legislator. Hancock Creek (also known as Hancock Branch) passes through
        Crestview and Brentwood along the divided street named Arroyo Seco and
        eventually flows into Shoal Creek. In the early 1950s, unpaved streets
        and swampy areas near the creek were challenging for builders and early
        residents, so the C. H. Lester Construction Company dug a deeper channel
        for the creek./
