        Your support of the Brentwood Neighborhood Association through your
        annual membership and/or donation is vital to our ability to do projects
        like the Hike & Bike Trail on Arroyo Seco.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dues are only <b>$10/household per year</b> (or $5/household, if senior
        citizen), so your ANNUAL support costs less than a healthy lunch -- what
        a deal! <b>Only residents of Brentwood are eligible for membership</b>;
        donations are welcome from all.
